## **The Motivation**
The idea for the analysis on the so-called "Convection-Diffusion Equation" *(Where its usually Advection that happens)*, popped out from a random internet search for topics to be taken up for numerical analysis.
I would consider it to be a feat that we could explore domains from Materials Science Engineering to Chemical Engineering. Understanding concepts like Control Volumes and Control Systems and how our naive high school analysis of such systems was backed up by such fundamental theorems like Reynold's Transport Theorem (RTT) that account for the realisation of any such scenario.

### The Diffusion
Although not needed for the project, we were able to explore the closeness of Diffusion Equation to Heat Equation and how these macro-level phenomenas had been derived from the Stochastic Processes as derived from Einstein's idea of Brownian Motion. It was all indeed fascinating to have things relate so well. Much apart from the numerical analysis was the deivation for the analytical solution, which although we haven't written about but was explored in interest. Few of the videos to do check out!:

It wasn't untill we presented our analysis that we got to know the
